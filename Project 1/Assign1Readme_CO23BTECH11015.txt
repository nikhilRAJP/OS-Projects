My code is in c programming language

    User has to do changes in input.txt and and to see results, they have to compile program 
    by following line in terminal.

    For chunk method

    gcc Assign1Src_CO23BTECH11015_chunk.c -o chunk -l pthread
    ./chunk 
    
    For mixed method

    gcc Assign1Src_CO23BTECH11015_mixed.c -o mixed -l pthread
    ./mixed 

    For sequential method

    gcc Assign1Src_CO23BTECH11015_sequence.c -o seq 
    ./seq 


 these program will automatically create output.txt where validation of rows , coloumns and subgrids is present 
  and at last sudoku is valid or not along with execution time in microseconds.
